\caption{Example energy planning task instructions and reduction goal summary. Participants were tasked with creating two action plans to help a hypothetical family reduce their energy consumption. The reduction goal was presented in one of three formats: kilowatt hours (kWh), percentage (\%), or U.S. dollars (USD).}
