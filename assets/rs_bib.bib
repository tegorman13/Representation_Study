  abstract = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households' behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

People may not know which behaviors are truly effective and may be insufficiently motivated to change their behaviors. We focus on one area of this problem by first analyzing existing decision aids, tools available to help users make effective decisions. We explore EPA's Energy Star program, DoE's EERE calculators, and LBNL's Home Energy Saver tool. We highlight their strengths and limitations and propose a framework to expand the functionality and uptake of the information through such aids. We suggest improvements along two broad areas. One area concerns the analytic capabilities and the information content of the decision aid, which focuses on (1) multiple goals and constraints, (2) hidden costs, and (3) heterogeneity in user characteristics. The other pertains to the framing so that users can easily process information through decision architecture by limiting choice overload and incorporating smart default options.},

  abstract = {In marketing efforts, messages are commonly tailored to audiences to ensure effective outcomes. One way to tailor messages consists in providing arguments that appeal to the characteristics of a specific target audience. However, this strategy can decrease the message's appeal to a non-target audience. Drawing on the concept of strategic ambiguity, an alternative strategy to tailor messages is proposed and tested. Strategically ambiguous messages provide arguments that appeal to several audiences (multiple audience tailoring). These messages combine attributes that are relevant to distinct audiences, and audiences are expected to pay selective attention to attributes that are most relevant for them. The effectiveness of one-audience and multiple-audience tailoring was compared in an experiment with credit-card holders. Single audience tailoring was the most effective form of tailoring. Multiple audience tailoring was more effective than unmatched tailoring in various conditions. The study enhances our understanding of message tailoring using ambiguity to increase marketing effectiveness.},

Research on social cognition and attribution theory suggests that effects of emotional messages on behavior are contingent on the inferred cause of the emotion (e.g., why a message was said in a happy or neutral voice). As a prerequisite, to have the intended effects on energy saving behaviors, Alexa's emotional messages have to trigger three basic social cognitions: (1) the emotional display has to be identified by residents; (2) residents have to correctly identify their behavior as a target of the emotional display; and (3) residents have to attribute the emotional display to that behavior. In two studies (N = 194 and N = 353), several conditions were identified that triggered these three basic social cognitions in a simulated environment.},

  abstract = {Human decision-making is plagued by many systematic errors. Many of these errors can be avoided by providing decision aids that guide decision-makers to attend to the important information and integrate it according to a rational decision strategy. Designing such decision aids used to be a tedious manual process. Advances in cognitive science might make it possible to automate this process in the future. We recently introduced machine learning methods for discovering optimal strategies for human decision-making automatically and an automatic method for explaining those strategies to people. Decision aids constructed by this method were able to improve human decision-making. However, following the descriptions generated by this method is very tedious. We hypothesized that this problem can be overcome by conveying the automatically discovered decision strategy as a series of natural language instructions for how to reach a decision. Experiment~1 showed that people do indeed understand such procedural instructions more easily than the decision aids generated by our previous method. Encouraged by this finding, we developed an algorithm for translating the output of our previous method into procedural instructions. We applied the improved method to automatically generate decision aids for a naturalistic planning task (i.e., planning a road trip) and a naturalistic decision task (i.e., choosing a mortgage). Experiment~2 showed that these automatically generated decision aids significantly improved people's performance in planning a road trip and choosing a mortgage. These findings suggest that AI-powered boosting might have potential for improving human decision-making in the real world.},

Psychologists currently answer such questions with psychometric methods, which analyze correlations across participant responses in survey data sets. In this article, we analyze the preferences that give rise to these correlations. Our approach uses (a) large language models (LLMs) to quantify everyday risky behaviors in terms of the attributes or reasons that may describe those behaviors, and (b) decision models to map these attributes and reasons onto participant responses. We show that LLM-based decision models can explain observed correlations between behaviors in terms of the reasons different behaviors elicit and explain observed correlations between individuals in terms of the weights different individuals place on reasons, thereby providing a decision theoretic foundation for psychometric findings. Since LLMs can generate quantitative representations for nearly any naturalistic decision, they can be used to make accurate out-of-sample predictions for hundreds of everyday behaviors, predict the reasons why people may or may not want to engage in these behaviors, and interpret these reasons in terms of core psychological constructs. Our approach has important theoretical and practical implications for the study of heterogeneity in everyday behavior.},

Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team's transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.},

In this paper, 121 households in four states were interviewed to investigate the cognitive process of decision-making for home upgrades at the intersection of individual self-identites, normative goals of households and their sociotechnical environment. We found that home upgrades occur typically as interconnected sets of projects. They are constituted of decision dilemmas between domestic space-making aspirations and technological choices, moderated by sentiments, opinions of peers, information, limiting factors and self-identities. Indoor upgrades are largely influenced by the functional and emotional goals of the household, whereas exterior and structurally complex upgrades are usually determined by parameters of the sociotechnical environment, including costs and available expertise. Behaviorally, functional needs and social situation of individuals are more influential to upgrade decisions than environmental values or ideological positions on decarbonization.},

In a randomized controlled trial, we investigated how descriptive and injunctive feedbacks interact to affect electricity use, and evaluate the effects of additional normative feedback presented in the form of descriptive or injunctive energy conservation norm primes. We found that consistent descriptive and injunctive feedback boosts the effectiveness of social information in inducing energy conservation. When descriptive and injunctive feedback are in conflict, conservation behaviour is a function of the relative strength of the two types of feedback. Additional normative feedback produces smaller gains when it reinforces existing information of the same type. These results suggest complementarities between different types of normative messages rather than superiority of any one kind of feedback.},

In two experiments, participants detected main and interaction effects in line graphs and tables of bivariate data. Graphs led to more efficient performance, but also lower flexibility, as indicated by a larger discrepancy in performance across tasks. In particular, detection of main effects of variables represented in the graph legend was facilitated relative to detection of main effects of variables represented in the x-axis. Graphs may be a preferable representational format when the desired task or analytical perspective is known in advance, but may also induce greater interpretive bias than tables, necessitating greater care in their use and design.},

Across scientific disciplines, most theoretical approaches that try to understand energy-related decisions and behaviors focus mainly on cognitive processes, such as computations of utility (typically economic), the impact of cognitive heuristics, or the role of individual beliefs. While these models already explain important aspects of human decisions and behavior in the energy domain, we argue that an additional consideration of the contributions of emotional processes may be very fruitful for a deeper understanding of the issue. In this contribution, we outline a theoretical perspective on energy-related decisions and behaviors that integrates emotions, elicited by a cognitive-affective appraisal of the relevance of a situation, into a response system driving adaptive decisions and behaviors. We empirically investigate the explanatory power of the model variables to predict intentions to reduce energy use demonstrating that the appraisal--emotion variables are able to account for additional variance that is not explained by two established models focused on cognitive processes (theory of planned behavior and value-belief-norm theory). Finally, we discuss how the appraisal--emotion approach may be fruitfully integrated with other existing approaches and outline some questions for future research.},

While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.},

  abstract = {Ordinal variables, although extremely common in psychology, are almost exclusively analyzed with statistical models that falsely assume them to be metric. This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

  abstract = {People's judgments and decisions often deviate from classical notions of rationality, incurring costs both to themselves and to society. One way to reduce the costs of poor decisions is to redesign the decision problems people face to encourage better choices. While often subtle, these nudges can have dramatic effects on behavior and are increasingly popular in public policy, healthcare, and marketing. Although nudges are often designed with psychological theories in mind, they are typically not formalized in computational terms and their effects can be hard to predict. As a result, designing nudges can be difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a computational framework for understanding and predicting the effects of nudges. Our framework builds on recent work modeling human decision-making as adaptive use of limited cognitive resources, an approach called resource-rational analysis. Concretely, nudges change the optimal sequence of cognitive operations an agent should execute, which in turn influences the agent's behavior. We first show that our framework can account for known effects of nudges based on default options, suggested alternatives, and information highlighting. In each case, we validate the model's predictions in an experimental process-tracing paradigm. We then show how the framework can be used to automatically construct optimal nudges, and demonstrate that these nudges improve people's decisions more than intuitive heuristic approaches. Overall, our results show that resource-rational analysis is a promising framework for formally characterizing and constructing nudges.},

  abstract = {Electricity bills could be an effective strategy for improving communications about consumers' electricity use and promoting electricity savings. However, quantitative communications about electricity use may be difficult to understand, especially for consumers with low energy literacy. Here, we build on the health communication and graph comprehension literature to inform electricity bill design, with the goal of improving understanding, preferences for the presented communication, and intentions to save electricity. In a survey-based experiment, each participant saw a hypothetical electricity bill for a family with relatively high electricity use, covering information about (a) historical use, (b) comparisons to neighbors, and (c) historical use with appliance breakdown. Participants saw all information types in one of three formats including (a) tables, (b) bar graphs, and (c) icon graphs. We report on three main findings. First, consumers understood each type of electricity-use information the most when it was presented in a table, perhaps because tables facilitate simple point reading. Second, preferences and intentions to save electricity were the strongest for the historical use information, independent of format. Third, individuals with lower energy literacy understood all information less. We discuss implications for designing utility bills that are understandable, perceived as useful, and motivate consumers to save energy.},

The paper continues with an analysis of international experience in order to find empirical evidence for which kinds of feedback work best. In spite of considerable data restraints and research gaps, there is some indication that the most successful feedback combines the following features: it is given frequently and over a long time, provides an appliance-specific breakdown, is presented in a clear and appealing way, and uses computerized and interactive tools.},

However, any claim against the existence of an algorithm, Bayesian or otherwise, is impossible to evaluate unless one specifies the information format in which it is designed to operate. The authors show that Bayesian algorithms are computationally simpler in frequency formats than in the probability formats used in previous research. Frequency formats correspond to the sequential way information is acquired in natural sampling, from animal foraging to neural networks. By analyzing several thousand solutions to Bayesian problems, the authors found that when information was presented in frequency formats, statistically naive participants derived up to 50\% of all inferences by Bayesian algorithms. Non-Bayesian algorithms included simple versions of Fisherian and Neyman-Pearsonian inference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Particularly confusing are single event probabilities, conditional probabilities (such as sensitivity and specificity), and relative risks. How can doctors improve the presentation of statistical information so that patients can make well informed decisions?  The science fiction writer H G Wells predicted that in modern technological societies statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write. How far have we got, a hundred or so years later? A glance at the literature shows a shocking lack of statistical understanding of the outcomes of modern technologies, from standard screening tests for HIV infection to DNA evidence. For instance, doctors with an average of 14 years of professional experience were asked to imagine using the Haemoccult test to screen for colorectal cancer.1 2 The prevalence of cancer was 0.3\%, the sensitivity of the test was 50\%, and the false positive rate was 3\%. The doctors were asked: what is the probability that someone who tests positive actually has colorectal cancer? The correct answer is about 5\%. However, the doctors' answers ranged from 1\% to 99\%, with about half of them estimating the probability as 50\% (the sensitivity) or 47\% (sensitivity minus false positive rate). If patients knew about this degree of variability and statistical innumeracy they would be justly alarmed. Statistical innumeracy is often attributed to problems inside our minds. We disagree: the problem is not simply internal but lies in the external representation of information, and hence a solution exists. Every piece of statistical information needs a representation--that is, a form. Some forms tend to cloud minds, while others foster insight. We know of no medical institution that teaches {\dots}},

In Germany, laundry accounts for about 5\% of domestic electricity consumption. In part, this is because users do not make use of the energy-saving programs offered by modern washing machines. Based on different principles of behavior change, we created four concepts for washing machine interfaces to encourage users to choose energy-saving programs and settings. These concepts were implemented as functional prototypes. An online experiment (N=400) showed that all concepts increased the choice of energy-saving programs compared to a standard machine. Especially effective was to interrupt impulsive actions and suggest alternative choices (concept B) and to restructure the entry of settings (concept E). This demonstrates how small changes in a standard interfaces can significantly increase the probability of energy conservation in a private setting.},

As a result, presenting an attribute in the default unit led to more favorable evaluations of superior products and less favorable evaluations of inferior products. This result was robust to changes in the numerical magnitude of the non-default unit. Moreover, when joint evaluation was performed across different units, products described using the default unit were evaluated more favorably than products described using a non-default unit. More favorable evaluations based on the default unit translated into a higher willingness to pay for efficiency advantages. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of default units to guide informed consumer judgments and effective energy efficiency labeling.},

In 4 experiments, the authors show that retrieval fluency can be a proxy for real-world quantities, that people can discriminate between two objects' retrieval fluencies, and that people's inferences are in line with the fluency heuristic (in particular fast inferences) and with experimentally manipulated fluency.

Herbert Simon, with his call for models of bounded rationality, can be seen as one of the fathers of the recently initiated research program on ``simple heuristics that make us smart'' (Gigerenzer/Todd/the ABC Research Group, 1999). These heuristics perform well because they are ecologically rational: they explore the structure of environmental information and are adapted to this structure. The present review paper introduces the key concepts of this research tradition, and provides two examples: (1) The recognition heuristic, which exploits a partial lack of knowledge, and (2) Take The Best, a simple lexicographic strategy that deliberately ignores information although it is available. The paper explains their ecological rationality, provides empirical evidence of their use, and illustrates some of their applications in consumer behaviour and group decision making. Finally, this research program is related to various notions of rationality.},

Although several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, their internal decisionmaking tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics theories, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. With a multiple-choice-list experiment, we initially estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities, but there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. Further, we explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features of human beings, uncovering significant disparities across various demographic characteristics. For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios. Therefore, this study advocates for the development of standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical boundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making environments.},

Adoption rates and the frequency of the usage of smart assistants vary across users and residential homes. Building on the theory of uses and gratifications (UGT) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2), the objective of this paper was to examine whether the intended use of a digital assistant would moderate the effects of performance expectancy and hedonic motivation on its adoption. Two experiments ( N = 345 and N = 351) tested the hypothesis that, for utilitarian purposes, devices with high performance appraisal are preferred, whereas for entertainment purposes, devices with high hedonic appraisal are preferred. The experiments manipulated the performance expectancy and hedonic motivation towards several digital assistants by varying how the assistants were introduced. Participants were asked which assistant they would choose for a variety of utilitarian and entertainment purposes. As expected, the experiments supported the proposed matching hypothesis, revealing that the devices that were high in performance appraisal were preferred for utilitarian tasks, whereas the devices high in hedonic appraisal were preferred for entertainment needs. These results suggest that a device's introduction can change people's perceptions of the device and subsequently their decision to use it.},

Here we conduct interviews with electrical engineers (n~=~10), physicists (n~=~10), and energy analysts (n~=~10) to document expert judgments about energy use and to identify their cognitive shortcuts (heuristics) for household energy decision making. Performance on an energy estimation task confirmed that energy experts have more accurate estimates of home energy use than novices. We document 24 unique expert heuristics related to device functions, components, and observable cues used by experts while making energy-use judgments. A follow-up survey with the experts indicated that these expert heuristics are generally more accurate than novice heuristics. The library of heuristics created in this study can be useful additions to education programs designed to improve public energy literacy and decision making.},

The prototypes were shown to consumers in qualitative interviews to gain information on how well they understood them and what kind of feedback they prefer to receive on their electricity consumption. The results show that the following features of feedback on electricity consumption are most valued by consumers: presentations of costs (over a period of time), appliancespecific breakdown, i.e. information on what proportion is consumed by each appliance, and historical comparison, i.e. comparison with their own prior consumption.},

  abstract = {Feedback is a promising strategy for energy conservation, and many energy feedback products (i.e. technologies with hardware) and platforms (i.e. technologies without hardware) have emerged on the market in recent years. Past research suggests that the effectiveness of feedback varies based on distinct characteristics, and proposes categories to better understand and distinguish between these characteristics. A review of existing categories, however, identified the following issues: (1) current structures group feedback technologies into four (or fewer) categories, making device distinction and selection onerous; (2) current categories often ignore technical and psychological distinctions of interest to researchers; and (3) none provide a systematic description of the specific characteristics that vary by category. This paper presents a classification structure of feedback technology, derived theoretically from a review of relevant literature and empirically via content analysis of 196 devices. A taxonomy structure of feedback technology was derived based on the characteristics of hardware, communications, control, display, and data collection. The resulting taxonomy included the following nine categories: (1) information platform, (2) management platform, (3) appliance monitor, (4) load monitor, (5) grid display, (6) sensor display, (7) networked sensor, (8) closed management network, and (9) open management network. These categories are mutual exclusive and exhaustive of the identified technologies collected and are based on characteristics, which are both stable and important to feedback provision. It is hoped that this feedback classification will be of use to both researchers and practitioners trying to leverage the potential of these technologies for energy conservation.},

  abstract = {Heating and cooling (HC) energy use is responsible for about 42\% of the total annual energy consumption of the average household in the U.S and it is significantly affected by residents' energy-related behavior. In this paper, our goal is to realize a new paradigm for energy-aware communities that leverages smart eco-feedback devices and social games to engage residents in understanding and reducing their home HC energy use. Towards this goal, we present a new sociotechnical modeling approach based on utility theory to reveal causal effects in human decision-making and infer attributes affecting the thermostat adjustment behavior of each household during an eco-feedback intervention. Our approach 1) is based on a utility model that quantifies residents' preferences over indoor temperatures given decision attributes related to their thermal environment and eco-feedback design and 2) incorporates latent parameters that determine the unique behavioral characteristics of each household. For parameter learning, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with non-centered parameterization calibrated using field data collected from a multi-unit residential community located in Fort Wayne, IN. The dataset comprises two parts; a baseline period without any behavioral intervention, and an intervention period, where personalized eco-feedback and social games are deployed through resident engagement devices with smart thermostat control capabilities, including a wall-mounted tablet and smart speaker. Through the model calibration, we quantify the impact of the eco-feedback on households' thermostat-adjustment behaviors. We propose that the utility model developed in this work can serve as the foundation for analyzing resident behavior in connected residential communities with eco-feedback energy-saving programs.},

Smart charging systems can reduce the stress of EV charging on the grid, but the potential of the technology depends on EV drivers' participation in smart charging schemes. To investigate this potential, we conducted an online randomised-controlled experiment with two waves (baseline and experimental phase, N~=~222), in which we examined drivers' preferences for smart charging and tested a behavioral intervention to increase the number of smart charging choices. We translated state-of-charge (SoC) information from percentage of battery level into miles corresponding to the battery level and tailored information, i.e., the number of driving days covered by the actual SoC based on participants' personal driving profiles. Participants preferred to use smart charging systems to decrease costs and to increase renewable energy use. However, they tended to overestimate the importance of the battery SoC when setting charging preferences. This overestimation was especially evident for participants who only drive short distances and may be lead to inefficient use of smart charging technology. Translating battery SoC into tailored information corrected for this bias and increased the number of smart charging choices. Our findings illustrate how behavioral interventions can be leveraged to attain energy transition goals.},

A series of four increasingly realistic experiments suggests that this approach can enable people to make better decisions faster, procrastinate less, complete their work on time and waste less time on unimportant tasks.

We also dissociate the effects of rewarding people for choosing effortful challenges and performing well.

There was also mixed evidence that rewarding effort increased willingness to choose harder tasks in another unrelated and unrewarded task (far transfer).

  abstract = {Widespread efforts are being made to mitigate environmental degradation driven by human activities. From a supply chain management perspective, companies aim at improving their environmental and organizational performance along their supply chain simultaneously. Since consumers are the sources of manufacturing companies' profitability, companies are interested in understanding the extent to which consumers care about their green practices. However, while some consumers would have a higher willingness to pay a premium (WPP) or purchase intention (PI) for environmentally differentiated products, others would not. Moreover, there is scant evidence regarding the integrated effects of intra- and inter-organizational green supply chain practices on green consumerism. Therefore, this study adopts two psychological approaches (i.e., protected values and halo effect) to describe this relationship based on two models that encompass mediation and moderation effects. Data were collected from 351 Colombian university students through a behavioral experiment with three product-based conditions, and the hypotheses were tested using two-instance repeated-measures linear regressions and non-parametric tests. The results indicate that perceived product performance mediates the effect of green supply chain practices on consumers' WPP and PI (halo effect). Additionally, consumers' moral orientation toward the environment (protected values) moderates the effects of green supply chain practices on consumers' WPP, PI and perceived product performance. The study found that people who hold protected values evaluate products better not just for its green attributes, but because of their increased perception of the products' performance. The contributions are centered on the role of psychological approaches in green supply chain studies to understand consumers' preferences.},

Two theoretical models that involve moderated mediation were tested through two-instance repeated-measures linear regressions and non-parametric tests in a behavioral experiment with an Amazon MTurk sample. In line with the expected halo effect, the effects of the renewability of the energy sources on consumers' adoption intentions and willingness to pay a premium were mediated through consumers' perceived comfort. These mediation effects were stronger among consumers with high protected values compared to those with low protected values. The results suggest that the positive evaluations of renewable energies by consumers with high protected values are mainly driven by those values. Conversely, consumers with low protected values would have lower adoption intentions, would be less willing to pay more, and they would not feel comfort at home when using renewable energy compared to consumers with high protected values.},

  abstract = {It is often unclear which factor plays a more critical role in determining a group's performance: the diversity among members of the group or their individual abilities. In this study, we addressed this ``diversity vs. ability'' issue in a decision-making task. We conducted three simulation studies in which we manipulated agents' individual ability (or accuracy, in the context of our investigation) and group diversity by varying (1) the heuristics agents used to search task-relevant information (i.e., cues); (2) the size of their groups; (3) how much they had learned about a good cue search order; and (4) the magnitude of errors in the information they searched. In each study, we found that a manipulation reducing agents' individual accuracy simultaneously increased their group's diversity, leading to a conflict between the two. These conflicts enabled us to identify certain conditions under which diversity trumps individual accuracy, and vice versa. Specifically, we found that individual accuracy is more important in task environments in which cues differ greatly in the quality of their information, and diversity matters more when such differences are relatively small. Changing the size of a group and the amount of learning by an agent had a limited impact on this general effect of task environment. Furthermore, we found that a group achieves its highest accuracy when there is an intermediate amount of errors in the cue information, regardless of the environment and the heuristic used, an effect that we believe has not been previously reported and warrants further investigation.},

Here we present a randomized online experiment that showed that home energy perceptions can be improved. We tested two simple, potentially scalable interventions: providing numerical information (in watt-hours) about extremes of energy use and providing an explicit heuristic that addressed a common misperception. Both succeeded in improving numerical estimates of energy use, but in different ways. Numerical information about extremes primarily improved the use of the watt-hours response scale, while the heuristic improved underlying understanding of relative energy use. As a result, only the heuristic significantly benefitted judgements about energy-conserving behaviours. Because understanding of energy use also predicted self-reported energy-conservation behaviour, belief in climate change, and support for climate policies, targeting energy misperceptions may have the potential to shape individual behaviour and national policy support.},

We show that energy insecurity is highly prevalent among households at or below 200\% of the federal poverty line. We further show that Black and Hispanic households are more likely to experience energy insecurity and face utility disconnection, as are households with young children, individuals that require electronic medical devices and those in dwellings with inefficient or poor conditions. These conditions exist under normal circumstances, and the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have exacerbated the overall incidence of energy insecurity.},

As an important feature, distribution system constraints such as equipment capacity, line flow limits, and phase balance constraints are taken into account. Due to the large amount of uncertainty in the residential demand, a two-stage pricing is considered. In the first stage, day-ahead prices as well as residential appliance scheduling are determined through interaction of the utility company and residential customers. Uncertainty of the customer demand is also considered in the day-ahead pricing. In the second stage, on the other hand, prices will be updated based on the actual residential loads. Similar to locational marginal price (LMP) in transmission system, customers on different nodes are charged with different prices. Performance of the approach is shown on a sample distribution system.},

This paper seeks to answer two main questions - whether these programs are broadly effective in inducing conservation, and what are the most effective versions of these programs. Using a meta-analysis of 116 studies, we examine the effects of information-based interventions on residential customers' consumption of electricity, gas, and water. We find evidence of publication bias in this literature. After correcting for publication bias, meta-analysis results indicate that information-based interventions reduce consumption by an average of 6.24\%, 95\% CI [-10.72, -1.76]. In addition, we find that studies employing RCTs find smaller conservation effects, (-5.2\%, 95\% CI [-9.53, -0.51]). Our results show that the effectiveness of information-based interventions at the household level are significantly larger than those at the aggregate level (such as dorms and buildings). Finally, interventions with a shorter duration or with more frequent reporting show larger estimated effect sizes.},

Simple information on the monetary value of energy savings was the most important element guiding cost-efficient energy efficiency investments, with information on physical energy use and carbon dioxide emissions having additional but lesser importance. The degree to which the current US EnergyGuide label guided cost-efficient decisions depends on the discount rate. Using elicited individual discount rates, the current EnergyGuide label came very close to guiding cost-efficient decisions. Using a uniform 5\% discount rate, the current label led to one-third undervaluation of energy efficiency. Our results reinforce the centrality of discounting in understanding individual behavior and guiding policy.},

We propose a method to integrate sentiment analysis and a non-Bayesian update mechanism, to analyze and interpret agents' beliefs and interactions systematically. This method allows us to observe the volatility of the sentiment associated with different agent statements, as well as the change in opinion throughout the agents' conversation. We further use it to model and compare collaborative decision-making approaches. We situate these agents in a simulated Human Resource recruiting environment as a case study to evaluate a candidate's fit for a role. We present a set of metrics to assess the quality of the agents' output. Finally, we explore cognitive biases in the agents' individual and collective opinion formation, a fundamental step to enhance decision-making capabilities and mitigate distortions in the system and the agents' collective reasoning.},

Collectives are vulnerable to hidden-profile environments, where task-relevant information is unevenly distributed across individuals. To do well in this task, information aggregation must equally weigh minority and majority views against simple but inefficient majority-based decisions. In an experimental design, human volunteers working in teams of 10 were asked to solve a hidden-profile prediction task. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn people's hidden information distribution by observing how people's judgments correlated over time. A bot was designed to sample responses from the VAE latent embedding to selectively support opinions proportionally to their under-representation in the team. We show that the presence of a single bot (representing 10\% of team members) can significantly increase the polarization between minority and majority opinions by making minority opinions less prone to social influence. Although the effects on hybrid team performance were small, the bot presence significantly influenced opinion dynamics and individual accuracy. These findings show that self-supervized machine learning techniques can be used to design algorithms that can sway opinion dynamics and group outcomes.},

Bounded rationality may have a significant impact on the effective implementation of more sustainable technologies that are already available. However, empirical evidence on the effects of bounded rationality in the building sector, such as cognitive biases, is still lacking. Here, we present an empirical investigation of four cognitive biases in the building environment, namely the framing, anchor, default, and decoy effect. For that, energy-related decisions situations were presented to approximately 270 participants in an online survey. Our results show that awareness of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings can be raised through framing that the willingness to pay more for an energy-efficient home can be increased by presenting it as default, and that the choices can be shifted towards more energy-efficient appliances by using a decoy. The hypothesis that anchoring increases the willingness to pay more for the installation of a solar system could not be supported. These findings decrease the lack of empirical data on cognitive biases in the context of buildings and further indicate the potential of choice architecture in the building environment. The influence of cognitive biases in energy-related decisions should be used to increase the adaptation of sustainable technologies.},

In this paper, a model is outlined in which the effect of performance attributions on group achievement is assumed to be mediated by the quality of group members' partner spaces (i.e. by their ability to recognize their partners' perspective on a problem). According to the model, the extent to which individuals try to take their partner's perspective is a function of their attributions for poor performance: the more group members attribute negative feedback on performance or disagreement about the correct problem solution to themselves relative to their partners, the more they will try to generate an adequate partner space. Additionally, it is assumed that the quality of the partner spaces has a direct impact on group achievement. These basic assumptions were confirmed by a study in which participants were asked to solve Tower of Hanoi problems in dyads, although attributions themselves did not directly predict achievement.},

In prior studies involving the ISM, groups typically functioned in a very specific information environment: All information items were provided in form of unique cues, which described only one of the choice alternatives among which the groups had to choose. Because this specific information environment may impact group discussions and decisions, we included an experimental condition incorporating common cues. In contrast to unique cues, common cues provide information on each and every choice option. As expected, groups in the commoncue condition showed a weaker sampling advantage for shared information, and chose the hidden-profile alternative more often than groups in the classic unique-cue condition.},

  abstract = {A new framework is introduced that models group decision making by using simple group heuristics (SIGH). We report results of a set of simulations that systematically varied (a) the group members' strategies (compensatory unit weight model, UWM, and a noncompensatory lexicographic heuristic, LEX), (b) the distribution of cue validities (J-shaped vs. linear), and (c) the quantity and quality of shared information. Individual decisions were aggregated by using a majority decision rule (proportionality in case of ties). (1) The simulations revealed strong effects of the distribution of cue validities on group performance. When validities were linearly distributed, UWM gained an 8\% better accuracy than LEX by considering all cues. Yet, if cue validities followed a J-shaped distribution, the much more frugal LEX surpassed the UWM by achieving a 16\% higher accuracy. (2) This effect was robust across different quantities of shared information. (3) Systematic allocation of information in favour of valid or invalid cues showed that the performance of UWM mainly depended on mean validity, whereas the performance of LEX was more strongly affected by the degree to which the most valid cues were shared.},

  abstract = {Dual-process models of persuasion (e.g., Heuristic Systematic Model) contrast the use of heuristics with systematic information processing. However, a great deal of attention is increasingly being devoted to the interplay between the two types of processing. We propose a multistage view that builds on dual-process models of persuasion but emphasizes the interplay between processing modes. According to this multistage view, there are contexts in which receivers first use systematic processes to derive information about expertise from argument quality and, subsequently, make use of the expertise heuristic to arrive at an attitude. We show that results of a classic study (Petty, Cacioppo, \& Goldman, 1981) are compatible with this view. Additionally, we report results of a study, in which the effect of argument quality on receivers' attitudes was partially mediated by perceived source expertise (Reimer, 2003). Two follow-up studies revealed that this mediation tended to be stronger among receivers reporting low self-expertise than among receivers reporting high selfexpertise.},

In particular, routines may help groups effectively reduce coordination requirements when solving interdependent tasks. A group that has developed a routine for solving a problem does not have to negotiate about each new task and about which group member will carry out which single step of the task (Malone \& Crowstone, 1994). However, as we know from the literature on learning transfer (VanLehn, 1996) and routine decision making (Betsch, Haberstroh, \& Hoehle, 2002), acquiring a routine sometimes impairs rather than improves performance. Such a negative learning transfer is most likely if problem solvers are provided with a novel task that shares surface features with the learning task but requires a different problem solution (VanLehn, 1989). If the acquisition of a routine leads to improved group performance, crucial to continued improvement is whether groups are able to detect changes in the task environment and adequately respond to novel task demands. Are groups more likely than individuals to detect such changes and adapt their routine to novel tasks?},

The chapter applies and extends the lens model to a persuasion context. Specifically, the chapter introduces the probabilistic persuasion theory (PPT) as a framework within which the quality of arguments can be defined and measured, and the cognitive processes involved in the selection and in the reception of arguments can be modeled. Construing persuasion within the framework of PPT has the surplus value of opening the door to a rich literature on information processing models in judgment and decision making. The chapter outlines basic assumptions of the new theory, exemplify its application, and discuss its heuristic value. The chapter begins by briefly reviewing dual-process models of persuasion and how they account for the impact of arguments on attitudes. Second, the chapter critically discusses the theories' implications for human rationality, particularly their equation of heuristic processing with irrationality. Third, the chapter describes basic tenets of PPT as an alternative account of persuasion that is based on a Brunswikian framework (Hammond \& Stewart, 2001). PPT asserts that persuasion can be construed as a decision-making process, in which a communicator provides information with the goal to influence a receiver's judgments and decisions. The chapter demonstrates how PPT can be used to specify these influence processes and to study the cognitive processes involved in the selection and reception of arguments. Forth, the chapter derives five testable predictions of the new theory and describe preliminary experimental evidence in support of this account.},

Next, participants were asked to solve several transfer tasks either individually or in pairs. However, the routine could not be applied directly to the transfer tasks but led to a long detour. As expected, the individuals surpassed the dyads, who insisted more strongly on their routine. This result fits with studies that corroborate the claim that groups are prone to a ``principle of inertia'' when solving problems or making decisions.},

Individual actions have to be coordinated with regard to the team objectives and with regard to the opponent team's actions. Although sports are considered behavioral tasks by their nature, performance may be strongly affected by cognitive processes. We review studies and give examples that demonstrate that the degree to which cognitions are shared and coordinated among the members of such teams influences the extent to which the individual actions are coordinated. The sharing and coordinating of cognitions pertain to the attention, information-processing, and action phases of the decision making and behavior process. We also discuss how feedback and coaching can affect information processing in teams such that coordination of actions is more likely to arise},

We argue that this does not rule out that receivers still make use of the expertise heuristic. Rather, they may consider argument quality to infer the expertise of the source.

A prediction that follows is that of the less-is-more effect: Recognizing fewer cities leads, under certain conditions, to more accurate inferences than recognizing more cities. We extend the recognition heuristic to group decision-making by developing majority and lexicographic models of how recognition information is used by groups. We formally show when the less-is-more effect is predicted in groups and we present a study where three-member groups performed the population comparison task. Several aspects of our data indicate that members who can use the recognition heuristic are, not in all but in most cases, more influential in the group decision process than members who cannot use the heuristic. We also observed the less-is-more effect and found that models assuming that members who can use the recognition heuristic are more influential better predict when the effect occurs.},

However, past literature has always studied these proximal cues in isolation---despite the fact that, during real-world perception, people are always integrating a variety of cues. Here, we investigate how people rely on a variety of cues, and how individual differences in the reliance on those cues predicts the ability to estimate home energy use.},

As major outcome variables, we measured the speed with which the process settled, the distributions of agents' final preferences, and the rate with which high-status members changed their initial preferences. The impact of the agents' decision strategies on the dynamics and outcomes of the influence process depended on features of their social environment. This held in particular true when agents contacted all of the neighbors with whom they were connected. When agents focused on high-status members and did not contact low-status neighbors, the process typically settled more quickly, yielded larger majority factions and fewer preference changes.

A central issue is our limited grasp of how human cognitive processes begin with a goal and form intentions for executing actions, a blindspot even in established interaction models such as Norman's gulfs of execution and evaluation. To address this gap, we theorize how end-users 'envision' translating their goals into clear intentions and craft prompts to obtain the desired LLM response. We define a process of Envisioning by highlighting three misalignments: (1) knowing whether LLMs can accomplish the task, (2) how to instruct the LLM to do the task, and (3) how to evaluate the success of the LLM's output in meeting the goal. Finally, we make recommendations to narrow the envisioning gulf in human-LLM interactions.},

  abstract = {People higher (vs. lower) in objective numeracy---the ability to use probabilistic and mathematical concepts---use numeric information more when making decisions. Specifically, they are more sensitive to numeric levels than the less numerate and use more numeric versus nonnumeric information. Greater attention to numbers may explain this effect, but little is known about objective numeracy's relation to numeric attention and possible subsequent effects on choice. Therefore, we investigated whether numeracy is related to greater attention to numbers and greater use of numbers in consumer judgments and choices. Crucially, we tested whether numeric attention mediated number use in choices. In three experiments, we provided participants with information about different consumer products (e.g., dishwasher). Participants received either numbers-only or both numbers and verbal information. In Study 1 (N = 548), participants were asked to rate product attractiveness. In Studies 2a and 2b (N = 187 and 399), participants instead chose between product pairs. Attention was recorded using Mouselab. Greater objective numeracy was not related to sensitivity to numbers, but it was related to using numeric (instead of verbal) information more when making choices. The association of numeracy and attention was inconsistent across studies, although a meta-analysis combining the studies revealed a weak but significant relation between numeracy and frequency of attending to numbers. This attention variable mediated the association of numeracy and number use in the more powered Study 2b (but not 2a). Our research highlights the potential of considering attention when studying numeracy and provides insights for designing decision aids.},

  abstract = {The current climate crisis requires pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) to be developed, engaged in, and spread to other people. Behavioural traces, i.e. evidence of other people's pro-environmental behaviour left in the shared environment, have shown to influence people towards being more pro-environmental. However, systematic research into behavioural traces of PEBs is missing. In a set of three surveys, we investigate which behavioural traces correspond to a number of pro- and anti-environmental behaviours identified from previous literature, how frequently these behavioural traces are encountered, their relation with engagement in behaviours, and whether behaviours can be inferred from traces. All studies are survey-based with a mix of open-ended questions (Surveys 1 \& 3) and rating scales (Survey 2). We use network analysis to identify partial correlations between behaviours and traces. A total of 66 traces uniquely attributed to 36 pro- and anti-environmental behaviours were identified. On average, each trace is observed monthly. Noticing traces correlated with engaging in related behaviours in 24 instances. Participants report that if they saw a trace more frequently, they expect they would be more likely to adopt the behaviour that produced the trace. Finally, participants were generally able to infer the causing behaviours when only presented the traces. We show that unique behavioural traces exist for a number of pro- and anti-environmental behaviours. Traces are noticed and relate to the constituting behaviours based on correlational and self-report evidence. Because of the wide variation between behaviours and their traces, further research into specific behaviours is warranted. Use of these findings for interventions are discussed.},

We develop two versions the model: one suitable for assessing between-participant anchoring effects, and another for assessing individual differences in anchoring effects. We then fit each model to data from two experiments, and demonstrate the model's utility in describing anchoring effects.},

For example, car fuel economy can be expressed as fuel efficiency (``miles per gallon''), fuel cost in dollars, or tons of greenhouse gases emitted. Each expression, or ``translation'', highlights a different aspect of the same attribute. We describe a new mechanism whereby translated attributes can serve as decision ``signposts'' because they (1) activate otherwise dormant objectives, such as pro-environmental values and goals, and (2) direct the person towards the option that best achieves the activated objective. Across three experiments we provide evidence for the occurrence of such signpost effects as well as the underlying psychological mechanism. We demonstrate that expressing an attribute such as fuel economy in terms of multiple translations can increase preference for the option that is better aligned with objectives congruent with this attribute (e.g., the more fuel-efficient car for those with pro-environmental attitudes), even when the new information is derivable from other known attributes. We discuss how using translated attributes appropriately can help align a person's choices with their personal objectives.},

Over the past decade, nudging interventions (i.e., arranging the environment to promote adaptive behavioral choices) have surged in popularity. Importantly, effective application of the nudging approach requires clear guiding principles with a firm basis in behavioral science. We present a framework for nudging interventions that builds on evidence about the goal-directed inferential processes underlying behavior (i.e., processes that involve context-dependent inferences about goals and the actions available to achieve these goals). We used this framework to develop nudging interventions that target context-relevant cognitive inferences. We examined the effectiveness of these inference nudging interventions for promoting two important types of societal behavior: pro-environmental actions and adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. As predicted, two online studies revealed that inference nudging interventions successfully increased energy conservation (Study 1) as well as social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis (Study 2). A field experiment found that inference nudging interventions increased hand disinfection in a real-life store during the COVID-19 crisis (Study 3). Our findings highlight the importance of applying state-of-the-art insights about the (inferential) determinants of behavior in behavior change interventions.},

To date, however, the literature appears to have arrived at few conclusions with regard to the performance of the two representations. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a theory, based on information processing theory, to explain under what circumstances one representation outperforms the other. The fundamental aspects of the theory are: (1) although graphical and tabular representations may contain the same information, they present that information in fundamentally different ways; graphical representations emphasize spatial information, while tables emphasize symbolic information; (2) tasks can be divided into two types, spatial and symbolic, based on the type of information that facilitates their solution; (3) performance on a task will be enhanced when there is a cognitive fit (match) between the information emphasized in the representation type and that required by the task type; that is, when graphs support spatial tasks and when tables support symbolic tasks; (4) the processes or strategies problem solvers use are the crucial elements of cognitive fit since they provide the link between representation and task; the processes identified here are perceptual and analytical; (5) so long as there is a complete fit of representation, processes, and task type, each representation will lead to both quicker and more accurate problem solving. The theory is validated by its success in explaining the results of published studies that examine the performance of graphical and tabular representations in decision making.},

  abstract = {Human interactive behavior is accountable for most of the variance between the observed and predicted energy consumption of buildings, and is accordingly acknowledged as a major field of research into limiting building-related energy consumption. A thorough understanding of occupant behavior is critical to facilitate a more reliable prediction of energy consumption and identifying means by which pro-environmental behaviors can be promoted. Insights and models from psychology and sociology appear to be best suited to improving such understanding, and this article contributes to this end by developing and testing a cognitive model that serves as the core of a numerical human-building interaction model. The proposed implementation builds on instance-based learning, a well-established cognitive modeling paradigm, is integrated into a thermodynamic building model, and complemented by perception models for the approximation of the thermal and olfactory perception of the environment. The model successfully learns to interact plausibly with a set of elements of a model room---a heating system, a window, and the actor's clothing---in order to establish predefined room conditions. Accumulation of context-specific instances in the declarative memory, which are retrieved and blended in a decision situation, provide the model with the flexibility to adapt its actions to very different climatic contexts, represented by the locations Stuttgart, Madrid, Stockholm, and Melbourne. Moreover, the model manages to find appropriate compromises if need satisfaction requires contradictory actions, such as in situations where satisfaction of the olfactory need requires opening the window and satisfaction of the thermal need requires keeping it closed. Despite its obvious complexity, the model must be considered to be a basic model, which restricts the immediate comparability of its results to human behavior data. However, the successfully applied plausibility checks clearly indicate the value of the cognitive approach to modeling human-building interaction.},

In this study, we explore the role of interface design choices in shaping individuals' decision-making processes in response to predictions presented on a shared information display in a strategic setting. We introduce a novel staged experimental design to investigate the effects of design features, such as visualizations of prediction uncertainty and error, within a repeated congestion game. In this game, participants assume the role of taxi drivers and use a shared information display to decide where to search for their next ride. Our experimental design endows agents with varying level-k depths of thinking, allowing some agents to possess greater sophistication in anticipating the decisions of others using the same information display. Through several extensive experiments, we identify trade-offs between displays that optimize individual decisions and those that best serve the collective social welfare of the system. We find that the influence of display characteristics varies based on an agent's strategic sophistication. We observe that design choices promoting individual-level decision-making can lead to suboptimal system outcomes, as manifested by a lower realization of potential social welfare. However, this decline in social welfare is offset by a reduction in the distribution shift, narrowing the gap between predicted and realized system outcomes, which potentially enhances the perceived reliability and trustworthiness of the information display post hoc. Our findings pave the way for new research questions concerning the design of effective prediction interfaces in strategic environments.},

  abstract = {Recent successes in natural language processing have led to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) by multiple providers. Each LLM offering has different inference accuracy, monetary cost, and latency, and their accuracy further depends on the exact wording of the question (i.e., the specific prompt). At the same time, users often have a limit on monetary budget and latency to answer all their questions, and they do not know which LLMs to choose for each question to meet their accuracy and long term budget requirements. To navigate this rich design space, we propose TREACLE (Thrifty Reasoning via Context-Aware LLM and Prompt Selection), a reinforcement learning policy that jointly selects the model and prompting scheme while respecting the user's monetary cost and latency constraints. TREACLE uses the problem context, including question text embeddings (reflecting the type or difficulty of a query) and the response history (reflecting the consistency of previous responses) to make smart decisions. Our evaluations on standard reasoning datasets (GSM8K, CSQA, and LLC ) with various LLMs and prompts show that TREACLE enables cost savings of up to 85\% compared to baselines, while maintaining high accuracy. Importantly, it provides the user with the ability to gracefully trade off accuracy for cost.},
