## Energy-Saving Decisions: Turning Goals into Appliance-Specific Allocations

- Despite decades of weatherization and bill relief programs, low-income households still spend a larger portion of their income on energy compared to any other income group (8.2%)
- every year, about 24 million low-income households in the US fail to pay their energy bills
- About 10 million suffering from utility service disconnection every year


## NSF Project Aims

## SCC-IRG Track 1: Sociotechnical Systems to Enable Smart and Connected Energy-Aware Residential Communities

- Foster energy-aware communities that can be scaled across the U.S. based on data analytics and predictive modeling

- Develop user-interactive devices and feedback mechanisms that optimize and incentivize energy management (35% reduction in energy use and costs; see Kim et al., 2022)

#### Opportunities to save energy may be very different for a family in Texas (cooling) and for a family in Massachusetts (heating).



## Research Questions and Hypothesis

### Research Questions:
- Can individuals **“translate”** energy use information into energy-saving actions (procedural knowledge)?
- Does it matter if we ask consumers to consider energy information represented as **absolute numbers** (kWh), **percentage of total energy use** (%), or in the form of **money spent** (USD)?

### Hypothesis:
Absolute numbers (kWh) should be easier to understand and deal with than the percentage of total energy use and money.



## Example

  - **kWh task, Colorado**
  - **% task, Texas**

## Sample


- Mturk: N = 252 (149 male)

- Age: 20-76; > 30: 155

- Income: < 50k: 101, 50k–80k: 95, > 80k: 56

- Education: no college degree: 60, college degree: 101, graduate degree or some grad school: 90 (1 missing)

- Employment: 201 full time

- States: > 30 states


## Results


- As expected, many energy users have great difficulty translating an overall energy-saving goal (e.g., to save 15% of the energy) into a plan that specifies the energy usage on the level of specific utilities.

- In our study, 61% of action plans had an error that was larger than 1% of the total used kWh. 47% of plans had an error that was larger than 5%, and 30% of plans had an error that was larger than 10%.

## Questions/Hypotheses

Gigerenzer, Peters

Reimer, Jones, & Skubisz (2015) describe that people often have trouble transforming information in one format to information in another format; some formats are easier to comprehend than others (frequencies vs. probabilities)

Research Questions:
Can individuals “translate” energy use information into energy-saving actions (procedural knowledge)?
Does it matter if we ask consumers to consider energy information represented as absolute numbers (kWh), percentage of total energy use (%), or in the form of money spent (USD)?

Hypothesis: 
Absolute numbers (kWh) should be easier to understand and deal with than the percentage of total energy use and money.

## Representation

- Numeric communication of energy use

- Save 10% of your energy!

- Examine numerical feedback about energy use commonly provided on electricity bills
    - Often presented in kWh or percentage of overall use
    - Not money (USD) despite our familiarity with paying for energy



## Results: Basic Descriptives

- Energy use: I consume more energy than average: 90, less: 121, do not know: 41

- Perceived knowledge (single item)
- Energy literacy/general knowledge (eight items)
- Accuracy of the plans: Error = absolute difference from correct answer
