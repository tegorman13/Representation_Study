A note on the percentage goals is that they are rounded to the full dollar. For instance, for the Davis family, 10% of their $6,943.95 cost of residential energy usage is $694.395; this is rounded to $694. For the rounded condition, participants are also told that “The numbers for their [the family’s] usage have been rounded for convenience.” In terms of randomization, blocks were combined so that there was a block for each condition and order combination. As an example, one block is the smith family with a 10% goal and rounded numbers for the family’s usage first, and the Wells family second, with a 15% goal and exact numbers for the family’s usage. Another block has these but in reverse, where the participant receives the Wells family first and the Smith family second. In total, there are 96 conditions, representing each possible order (2 orders x 4 states x 2 possible significant digit values, and 3 reference classes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Reference\n15% kWh\n10% kWh\n15% USD\n10% USD\n15% Percent\n10% Percent\n\n\n\n\nAdams / Cali\n3,401\n2,267\n$510\n$340\n15%\n10%\n\n\nSmith / Texas\n4,357\n2,905\n$479\n$320\n15%\n10%\n\n\nWells / Colorado\n5,965\n3,977\n$656\n$438\n15%\n10%\n\n\nDavis / Mass\n6,944\n4,629\n$1,042\n$694\n15%\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Reference\n15% kWh\n10% kWh\n15% USD\n10% USD\n15% Percent\n10% Percent\n\n\n\n\nAdams / Cali\n3,450\n2,300\n$518\n$345\n15%\n10%\n\n\nSmith / Texas\n4,350\n2,900\n$479\n$319\n15%\n10%\n\n\nWells / Colorado\n6,000\n4,000\n$660\n$440\n15%\n10%\n\n\nDavis / Mass\n6,900\n4,600\n$1,035\n$690\n15%\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n1,289\n2,581\n3,000\n\n\nHeating\n5,597\n6,157\n6,000\n\n\nWater heating\n4,601\n5,061\n5,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,055\n1,266\n1,000\n\n\nOther\n6,916\n7,608\n8,000\n\n\nTotal\n19,458\n22,673\n23,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n4,249\n6,573\n7,000\n\n\nHeating\n5,099\n6,118\n6,000\n\n\nWater heating\n4,396\n5,257\n5,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,318\n2,639\n3,000\n\n\nOther\n7,883\n8,459\n8,000\n\n\nTotal\n22,945\n29,046\n29,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n489\n697\n1,000\n\n\nHeating\n16,411\n18,052\n18,000\n\n\nWater heating\n5,832\n11,667\n12,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,142\n1,370\n1,000\n\n\nOther\n6,652\n7,982\n8,000\n\n\nTotal\n30,535\n39,768\n40,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n322\n419\n0\n\n\nHeating\n19,108\n26,751\n27,000\n\n\nWater heating\n5,070\n10,543\n11,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,025\n1,230\n1,000\n\n\nOther\n6,682\n7,350\n7,000\n\n\nTotal\n32,207\n46,293\n46,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study seeks to examine how the type of numeric energy information given to individuals influences their ability to create an energy-saving action plan in a home. Specifically, it examines how the modality affects the accuracy of an energy-saving action plan in a family household scenario. The design is 3 modalities (percent reduction goal, absolute reduction goal in kWh, dollar reduction goal) X 6 states/families X 2 reduction goal conditions (15% and 25%). It is expected that the absolute reduction amount (kWh) action plans will be easier to complete with accuracy than the dollar reduction amount and the percentage reduction amount action plans.\nThe next step is to analyze the data from the initial study in depth. This data can then be used to inform how we make further changes to the next studies. This study included “families” from 6 states, the 3 modalities, and the 15% goal condition. The numbers for this initial study were not rounded. Due to ordering bias, the first families seen from each modality (percent, kWh, dollars) will be compared.\nFuture tasks for this study include finalizing the survey with rounded numbers in Qualtrics and copying it to make another condition in which the goal reduction number is 25%.

    "text": "In the re-launch of the frequency and probability study, the new design is a 4 state temperature (2 warm vs. 2 cold states) X 2 task goal (10% vs. 15%) X 2 last year’s usage for the family and the state average (exact vs. rounded numbers) within X 3 task reference class (USD vs. Percentage vs. kWh) between. A note on the percentage goals is that they are rounded to the full dollar. For instance, for the Davis family, 10% of their $6,943.95 cost of residential energy usage is $694.395; this is rounded to $694. For the rounded condition, participants are also told that “The numbers for their [the family’s] usage have been rounded for convenience.” In terms of randomization, blocks were combined so that there was a block for each condition and order combination. As an example, one block is the smith family with a 10% goal and rounded numbers for the family’s usage first, and the Wells family second, with a 15% goal and exact numbers for the family’s usage. Another block has these but in reverse, where the participant receives the Wells family first and the Smith family second. In total, there are 96 conditions, representing each possible order (2 orders x 4 states x 2 possible significant digit values, and 3 reference classes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Reference\n15% kWh\n10% kWh\n15% USD\n10% USD\n15% Percent\n10% Percent\n\n\n\n\nAdams / Cali\n3,401\n2,267\n$510\n$340\n15%\n10%\n\n\nSmith / Texas\n4,357\n2,905\n$479\n$320\n15%\n10%\n\n\nWells / Colorado\n5,965\n3,977\n$656\n$438\n15%\n10%\n\n\nDavis / Mass\n6,944\n4,629\n$1,042\n$694\n15%\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState/Reference\n15% kWh\n10% kWh\n15% USD\n10% USD\n15% Percent\n10% Percent\n\n\n\n\nAdams / Cali\n3,450\n2,300\n$518\n$345\n15%\n10%\n\n\nSmith / Texas\n4,350\n2,900\n$479\n$319\n15%\n10%\n\n\nWells / Colorado\n6,000\n4,000\n$660\n$440\n15%\n10%\n\n\nDavis / Mass\n6,900\n4,600\n$1,035\n$690\n15%\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n1,289\n2,581\n3,000\n\n\nHeating\n5,597\n6,157\n6,000\n\n\nWater heating\n4,601\n5,061\n5,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,055\n1,266\n1,000\n\n\nOther\n6,916\n7,608\n8,000\n\n\nTotal\n19,458\n22,673\n23,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n4,249\n6,573\n7,000\n\n\nHeating\n5,099\n6,118\n6,000\n\n\nWater heating\n4,396\n5,257\n5,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,318\n2,639\n3,000\n\n\nOther\n7,883\n8,459\n8,000\n\n\nTotal\n22,945\n29,046\n29,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n489\n697\n1,000\n\n\nHeating\n16,411\n18,052\n18,000\n\n\nWater heating\n5,832\n11,667\n12,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,142\n1,370\n1,000\n\n\nOther\n6,652\n7,982\n8,000\n\n\nTotal\n30,535\n39,768\n40,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nState average\nExact\nRounded\n\n\n\n\nCooling\n322\n419\n0\n\n\nHeating\n19,108\n26,751\n27,000\n\n\nWater heating\n5,070\n10,543\n11,000\n\n\nRefrigerator\n1,025\n1,230\n1,000\n\n\nOther\n6,682\n7,350\n7,000\n\n\nTotal\n32,207\n46,293\n46,000",

    "text": "This study seeks to examine how the type of numeric energy information given to individuals influences their ability to create an energy-saving action plan in a home. Specifically, it examines how the modality affects the accuracy of an energy-saving action plan in a family household scenario. The design is 3 modalities (percent reduction goal, absolute reduction goal in kWh, dollar reduction goal) X 6 states/families X 2 reduction goal conditions (15% and 25%). It is expected that the absolute reduction amount (kWh) action plans will be easier to complete with accuracy than the dollar reduction amount and the percentage reduction amount action plans.\nThe next step is to analyze the data from the initial study in depth. This data can then be used to inform how we make further changes to the next studies. This study included “families” from 6 states, the 3 modalities, and the 15% goal condition. The numbers for this initial study were not rounded. Due to ordering bias, the first families seen from each modality (percent, kWh, dollars) will be compared.\nFuture tasks for this study include finalizing the survey with rounded numbers in Qualtrics and copying it to make another condition in which the goal reduction number is 25%. When we have both the rounded 15% and 25% conditions, we can launch it on Amazon mTurk.
