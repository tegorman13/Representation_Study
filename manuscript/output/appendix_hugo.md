### Tables

**?@tbl-s2-prop** shows that, once again, participants in the kWh condition achieved closer alignment with the target goals (44% exact matches), followed by Percentage (27%) and USD (18%). These percentages are consistent with the patterns observed in Study 1, reinforcing the conclusion that providing goals in kWh supports better accuracy.

### Goal Manipulation

### Rounding

### Individual Differences

As in Experiment 1, we further investigated the role of individual differences in energy literacy in predicting planning accuracy. A Bayesian linear regression model, analogous to the one used in Experiment 1 (log_abs_error ~ els + (1\|id) + (1\|state)), revealed a significant negative relationship between energy literacy scores and log-transformed absolute error (Estimate = -3.21, 95% CI: -3.89 to -2.52). This finding indicates that participants with higher energy literacy scores tended to produce more accurate plans, exhibiting smaller deviations from the target reduction goals. The conditional effect plot (**?@fig-s2-els**) visually confirms this relationship, showing a clear decreasing trend in log absolute error as energy literacy increases.

### Tables

### Distance plots

Additional data collected included:

-   **Energy Literacy Quiz**: An 8-item questionnaire assessing participants' knowledge of energy consumption and conversion (DeWaters & Powers, 2011).
-   **Calculator Usage Tracking**: Questions determined whether participants used a calculator, paper/pen, or other methods to complete the tasks.
-   **Demographic Survey**: Collected information on gender, age, income, education, employment status, and state of residence.
-   **Environmental Attitudes Survey**: Assessed participants' pro-environmental attitudes and perceived importance of energy conservation.
