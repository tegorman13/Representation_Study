What is wrong with this idea?\n    - [x] Most electricity is currently produced from fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)\n    - [ ] Switching to electric cars will make unemployment rates go up\n    - [ ] It has been proven that it is impossible to build electric cars in great quantities\n    - [ ] You can't use electricity to operate a car\n    - [ ] There is nothing wrong with this idea\n\n\nDeWaters, J.

A Bayesian linear regression model, analogous to the one used in Experiment 1 (log_abs_error ~ els + (1|id) + (1|state)), revealed a significant negative relationship between energy literacy scores and log-transformed absolute error (Estimate = -3.21, 95% CI: -3.89 to -2.52). This finding indicates that participants with higher energy literacy scores tended to produce more accurate plans, exhibiting smaller deviations from the target reduction goals. The conditional effect plot (@fig-s2-els) visually confirms this relationship, showing a clear decreasing trend in log absolute error as energy literacy increases.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Study 2: Individual performance in the energy planning task, colored by reference class.
