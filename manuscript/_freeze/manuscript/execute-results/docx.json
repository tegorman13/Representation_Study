By manipulating the reference class (kWh, %, USD) and assessing planning accuracy, we seek to determine which format facilitates better comprehension and decision-making.Across two experiments, the kWh format generally led to better accuracy, while the USD format consistently led to the worst performance. These findings highlight the importance of effective information presentation to promote energy conservation, and may contribute to the development of more effective energy communication strategies that can enhance conservation efforts.\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n\n- highlight the significant contribution of residential energy consumption to carbon emissions and the potential for substantial reductions. Make point about urgency of climate change? (IPCC (2014) and EIA (2012) ).\n\n- Electricity bills are a primary source of energy-use information for consumers and offer a promising avenue for enhancing communication about energy consumption [@fischerFeedbackHouseholdElectricity2008]\n\n\n### Literature Review\n\n\n\nEnergy poverty continues to be a pervasive issue in the United States @memmottSociodemographicDisparitiesEnergy2021. This challenge partly arises from difficulties in converting information across numerical formats, impeding the development of precise energy reduction plans @reimerNumericCommunicationRisk2015. Prior research by @canfieldPerceptionsElectricityuseCommunications2017 demonstrated that presenting energy information in tabular formats enhances comprehension relative to graphs. \n\n\nThe way numerical information is presented can significantly affect how individuals process and use that information [@reimerNumericCommunicationRisk2015] . The reference class problem highlights that numbers without clear reference points can lead to misinterpretation, as the meaning of a statistic depends on the category or class it refers to [@gigerenzerSimpleToolsUnderstanding2003; @reimerNumericCommunicationRisk2015]. Presenting energy information in absolute units (e.g., kWh) provides a clear reference class, potentially enhancing comprehension.\n\n\nThe concept of cognitive fit posits that performance improves when the information presentation format aligns with the task requirements [@vesseyCognitiveFitTheoryBased1991], and that such an alignment can reduce cognitive load and enhance accuracy in planning [@shahBarLineGraph2011]. For instance, tables are generally more effective than graphs for conveying specific electricity usage data because they facilitate straightforward point reading [@canfieldPerceptionsElectricityuseCommunications2017]. However, the effectiveness of the format varies with the type of information and individual differences, such as energy literacy, which significantly impacts comprehension and conservation intent. Moreover, the unit in which numerical information is presented influences how decision-makers evaluate and choose between options, with default units increasing value sensitivity [@herberzKiloWhatDefault2020]. In the context of energy, presenting information in terms of multiple translations can increase preference for options aligned with activated objectives, such as pro-environmental values [@ungemachTranslatedAttributesChoice2018]. Furthermore, mental accounting mechanisms, where individuals create mental budgets linking specific consumption acts to specific payments, significantly impact energy decisions and behaviors [@hahnelMentalAccountingMechanisms2020]. \n\nEvidence from research on energy consumption feedback, normative comparisons, and eco-feedback platforms suggests that comprehensible and contextually meaningful data presentations can improve users’ ability to plan reductions, especially when these formats are integrated into daily routines [@canfieldPerceptionsElectricityuseCommunications2017; @fischerFeedbackHouseholdElectricity2008; @kimMySmartEEcofeedbackGaming2022; @schwartzWhatPeopleConsumption2015]. Furthermore, temporal and monetary frames have been shown to alter decision quality, with monthly costs or absolute consumption levels often encouraging more energy-efficient intentions than abstract annual or percentage-based metrics [@gillConsumerMatchingCosts2022; @larrickMPGIllusion2008]. In this context, tailoring reference classes to align with intuitive cognitive processes can help bridge the gap between aggregate reduction goals and targeted, appliance-specific conservation strategies.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, research suggests that natural frequencies and absolute numbers are generally easier for individuals to understand compared to percentages or probabilities [@gigerenzerHowImproveBayesian1995 @hoffrageCommunicatingStatisticalInformation2000]. In the context of energy conservation, using absolute units may facilitate more accurate planning and decision-making by aligning with intuitive cognitive processing.\n\nDespite existing studies on energy-use communication and format effects, limited research has explored how different numerical representations influence consumers’ ability to create accurate energy conservation plans. Specifically, there is a gap in understanding how presenting energy information in absolute units versus percentages or monetary terms affects the precision of planning appliance-specific reductions. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing effective interventions that promote energy conservation behaviors.\n\n### Hypotheses\n\nBuilding on these findings and informed by prior work showing that frequencies (like absolute units in kWh) are easier to comprehend and facilitate more precise decision-making compared to percentages, our study also utilizes a tabular format, but manipulates whether participants must consider energy information presented as absolute units (kWh), percentages (%), or monetary costs (USD). We hypothesize that presenting information in absolute units (kWh) will lead to more accurate household energy conservation planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Experiment 1\n\nSee @fig-task for an example of a planning trial as it was seen by participants.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Participants\n\nWe implemented our task and surveys on Qualtrics, and recruited participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk. In Experiment 1, 252 participants were initially recruited, but data from 17 participants were corrupted due to experimenter error, leaving a final sample of 235 participants. Most participants (76%) reported using a calculator to complete the task. \n\n\n### Materials and Design \n\nThe study employed a mixed design with reference class (kWh, percentage, USD) as a between-subjects factor and state/family scenario as a within-subjects factor. Each participant completed energy reduction planning tasks for two different states, with state order counterbalanced across participants. The family scenarios featured four households in different climate regions: Texas (Smith family) and California (Adams family) representing warm climates, and Colorado (Wells family) and Massachusetts (Davis family) representing cold climates. We obtain average utility use from each state by CITE SOURCE FOR STATE AVGS? \n\n\n### Procedure\n\nParticipants received energy usage data for two hypothetical families and were tasked with creating action plans to meet specified reduction goals by allocating usage across five appliance categories:  heating, cooling, water heating, refrigerator, and and other appliances (e.g., TV, lighting).\n\nFor each family scenario, the participants were shown a table containing the families utility usage from the prior year, alongside the state averages for each appliance category (both prior year usage and stage averages are always shown in kWh). For each scenario, participants were asked to create two possible action plans to achieve the target reduction in total household energy usage (see @fig-task). Depending on their reference class condition, the target reduction amount presented either in kilowatt-hours (kWh), as percentages of total household usage, or in U.S. dollars. In all conditions, the target reduction was equivalent to a 15% reduction in total household kWh. \n\n![Example trial in the energy planning task. Participants are shown the prior year electricity use of a household, and are tasked with creating a plan for the next year that will meet the energy reduction goal. Study 1 manipulates the format of the reduction goal to be either a percentage (15% given as goal reduction), kilowatt hours (5965 kWh given), or USD (\\$656)](/assets/images/Smith_10R_Wells_15E.png){#fig-task}\n\n\nAdditional data collected included:\n\n-   **Energy Literacy Quiz**: An 8-item questionnaire assessing participants' knowledge of energy consumption and conversion.\n-   **Calculator Usage Tracking**: Questions determined whether participants used a calculator, paper/pen, or other methods to complete the tasks.\n-   **Demographic Survey**: Collected information on gender, age, income, education, employment status, and state of residence.\n-   **Environmental Attitudes Survey**: Assessed participants' pro-environmental attitudes and perceived importance of energy conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n\n### Data Analysis\n\nAll preprocessing and analyses were carried out in R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] and the tidyverse package [@wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019].

This indicates that, compared to the kWh condition, participants in both the Percentage and USD conditions were more likely to produce plans that fell into higher error categories. Moreover, the odds ratios (see Table 3) suggest that the USD condition led to a notably higher likelihood of large errors compared to the kWh baseline (OR = 15.7), while the Percentage condition also demonstrated increased odds (OR = 3.7) but was somewhat less detrimental to accuracy than USD. These results align with our descriptive findings and further clarify that framing the target reductions in absolute kWh units may facilitate significantly more accurate planning.

In line with our hypothesis that absolute units would yield better accuracy, the kWh condition supported significantly more precise energy reduction plans than did either the Percentage or USD conditions. Although the Percentage format was detrimental to accuracy relative to kWh, it was the USD condition that consistently produced the poorest outcomes, suggesting that monetary terms, while intuitive in everyday contexts, may not serve as effective reference classes for planning appliance-specific reductions in energy use.\n\nExperiment 2 will extend these findings by examining whether additional variables, such as the difficulty of the reduction goal or the rounding of numerical values, further interact with reference class conditions, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of how to optimize energy information presentation for improved planning accuracy.\n\n\n# Experiment 2\n\n\n## Methods\n\nThe experimental procedures in study 2 are quite similar to those in study 1, but we also included a rounding manipulation (rounded vs. not rounded), and a manipulation of the goal (10% reduction vs. 15% rediction). We recruited 206 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk, but data from from 10 participants were corrupted due to experimenter error, leaving a final sample of 196 participants.\n\nNote that reference class remains a between-subjects variable, while percent goal, rounding, and state are within-subjects variables. In study 2, the new design is a 4 state temperature (2 warm vs. 2 cold states) X 2 task goal (10% vs. 15%) X 2 last year’s usage for the family and the state average (exact vs. rounded numbers) within X 3 task reference class (USD vs. Percentage vs. kWh) between.\n\n## Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-s2-agg}\n\n|Reference Class |% meeting goal (exact) |% meeting goal (close match) |Abs.

Thus, while rounding facilitated more\naccurate responses, the more difficult goal reduced overall accuracy.\nCrucially, the kWh condition’s advantage persisted across these\nadditional manipulations, reinforcing the conclusion from Experiment 1\nthat absolute units support better accuracy in energy reduction\nplanning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](manuscript_files/figure-docx/fig-s2-ppd-1.png){#fig-s2-ppd}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Individual Differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Study 2: Individual performance in the energy planning task, colored by reference class.
