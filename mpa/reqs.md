https://midwesternpsych.org/meeting/submissions/

Submissions for papers, posters, professional development sessions, and symposia for the annual meeting will be accepted through November 6th, 2024 11:59PM EST.


###  Papers, Posters, and Professional Development Sessions Submissions

To submit a poster, paper, or Professional Development Session please prepare two abstracts describing your work: one 400-word abstract to be reviewed by the Program Committee and one 50-word abstract that we will appear in the Program Book if your submission is accepted. Instructions for abstracts appear below:

_****For Papers and Posters****_

**Title**: Your title should be 10 words or fewer in length.

_****400-word Abstract for Review.****_ The name(s) and institution(s) of the author(s) must not appear on the abstract since these are reviewed blind. The following format should be used, including the headings:

****A.****   Problem or Purpose: The Committee finds it helpful to have the paper put in context, perhaps even with references.  
****B.****   Procedure: State the rationale, design, controls, sample sizes, characteristics of the sample you collected.  
****C.****   Results (including statistical tests have been employed and the statistical results you found as you would include in a paper). Only empirical papers/posters will be accepted.  
****D.****   Conclusions and implications.

It is important that you provide adequate background information in the form of references (in text citations only, no need to include full references) and names of investigators or theories to help reviewers evaluate your abstract. The blind reviewing process does not permit reviewers to determine the background on the basis of the author(s) names(s).

You have the option of uploading one document containing tables or figures to supplement your 400-word abstract. Your tables or figures must be in pdf format to be uploaded. Only upload tables and figures. Please do not upload any other portions of your 400-word abstract.

**If your POSTER is NOT complete**, please describe the procedures you have done/plan to do; the results you have conducted/plan to do; and the status and timeline of your study completion. You will not be able to present at MPA if you do not finish your study in time and you must explain to reviewers the status of your study and your timeline of completion. You will be evaluated both on the theoretical merit and method design (as anyone else would be) as well as whether you appear likely to finish the submission in time so please be detailed in your responses.

_****50-word Abstract for Program.****_ A short abstract not to exceed 50 words is also required. If your paper is accepted, this abstract and all of your contact information will be inserted directly into the program, so proofread it carefully.
