Planning to Save Energy: How Information Format Affects Accuracy

Purpose

Energy poverty continues to be a pervasive issue in the United States (Memmott et al., 2021). This challenge partly arises from difficulties in converting information across numerical formats, impeding the development of precise energy reduction plans (Reimer et al., 2015). Prior research by Canfield et al. (2017) demonstrated that presenting energy information in tabular formats enhances comprehension relative to graphs. Building on these findings and informed by prior work showing that frequencies (like absolute units in kWh) are easier to comprehend and facilitate more precise decision-making compared to percentages, our study also utilizes a tabular format, but manipulates whether participants must consider energy information presented as absolute units (kWh), percentages (%), or monetary costs (USD). We hypothesize that presenting information in absolute units (kWh) will lead to more accurate household energy conservation planning.

Procedure

We conducted two experiments. Study 1 (N=235) manipulated representation format (kWh, percentage, USD) between subjects. Participants crafted plans to meet specific reduction targets by adjusting the energy usage across five appliance categories. Study 2 (N=196) includes additional factors: rounding (rounded vs. exact numbers) and task goal (10% vs. 15% reduction).

Results

We analyzed planning accuracy using Bayesian ordinal regression. The dependent variable, plan error, was computed by binning the goal deviation into four ordered levels: exact match (0% error), minor deviations (0.01-2% error), moderate deviations (2.01-15% error), and major deviations (>15% error). For each comparison, we provide posterior odds ratios (OR) and their 95% CIs.

In Study 1, the absolute units (kWh) condition was significantly more accurate than USD (OR = 14.1, 95% CI [4.1, 38.0]). The comparison between kWh and percentage formats was less conclusive (OR = 2.3, 95% CI [0.62, 6.1]). Study 2 replicated these patterns: planning accuracy was significantly higher for kWh compared to USD (OR = 3.69, 95% CI [1.33, 8.29]), while the advantage over percentages remained uncertain (OR = 1.99, 95% CI [0.73, 4.43]). Study 2 also revealed that rounded numbers significantly improved planning accuracy compared to exact numbers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.57, 0.84]), and that 10% goals led to more accurate planning than 15% goals (OR = 0.78, 95% CI [0.63, 0.94]).

Conclusions and Implications

These findings underscore the efficacy of presenting energy reduction goals in absolute units (kWh) over relative (%) or monetary (USD) formats in facilitating accurate energy planning. Specifically, the USD format consistently hindered accuracy. Additionally, simplifying numerical information through rounding significantly enhanced accuracy.


50-Word Abstract for Program Book

This study examines how presenting energy information in different formats (kWh, %, USD) affects planning accuracy. Across two experiments, the kWh format generally led to better accuracy, while the USD format consistently led to the worst performance. These findings highlight the importance of effective information presentation to promote energy conservation.
