# Study Stimulii 




## Research Questions and Hypothesis

### Research Questions:

1. Can individuals "*translate*" energy use information into energy-saving actions (procedural knowledge)?

2. Does it matter if we ask consumers to consider energy information represented as:
   - *absolute numbers* (kWh)
   - *percentage of total energy use* (%)
   - *money spent* (USD)?

### Hypothesis:

Absolute numbers (kWh) should be easier to understand and deal with than the percentage of total energy use and money.



## Study 1 methods

• Participants receive energy use information found on electricity bills of various families

• Four families from different states in the U.S.: California, Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts
  • Each family has a bill that shows appliance breakdown data over the last year
  • Information is provided in the form of kWh, %, or USD

• Each participant was asked to come up with two action plans for a 15% saving for each of two states

• Presentation format was manipulated between subjects

• 24 different blocks of experimental materials to which participants were randomly assigned

- The primary manipulation of Study 1 is which reference class (kWh, dollars, or percent) participants were assigned to.

### Other Questions


**General Information**

In this study, electricity use is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh).

A kilowatt hour (symbol kWh) is a unit of energy. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt hours is the power in kilowatts multiplied by the time in hours.

Examples:
- An incandescent lightbulb turned on for 5 hours uses 0.30 kWh.
- A microwave used for a total of 30 minutes uses 0.60 kWh.
- A central air conditioner used for 3 hours uses 10.50 kWh.

**Appliance Energy Question** \

Which of these appliances do you think needs the most energy in average households in Texas over the time period of a year?

- [ ] Cooling (Central A/C)
- [ ] Heating the Home
- [ ] Water Heating
- [ ] Refrigerator
- [ ] Other (Television, Lighting, Electronics, Washer/Dryer, etc.)



**Rank Energy per appliance question** \

How much energy do you think the average household of a family of four in Texas uses for each appliance per year? Please rank each appliance based on how many kWh you believe it uses per year, with 1 being the most kWh used per year and 5 being the least kWh used per year.

*Please rank in order:*

1. [ ] Cooling (Central A/C)
2. [ ] Heating the Home
3. [ ] Water Heating
4. [ ] Refrigerator
5. [ ] Other (Television, Lighting, Electronics, Washer/Dryer, etc.)
