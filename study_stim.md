# Study Stimulii and Design




## Research Questions and Hypothesis

### Research Questions:

1. Can individuals "*translate*" energy use information into energy-saving actions (procedural knowledge)?

2. Does it matter if we ask consumers to consider energy information represented as:
   - *absolute numbers* (kWh)
   - *percentage of total energy use* (%)
   - *money spent* (USD)?

### Hypothesis:

Absolute numbers (kWh) should be easier to understand and deal with than the percentage of total energy use and money.


## Study 1 methods

• Participants receive energy use information found on electricity bills of various families

• Four families from different states in the U.S.: California, Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts
  • Each family has a bill that shows appliance breakdown data over the last year
  • Information is provided in the form of kWh, %, or USD

• Each participant was asked to come up with two action plans for a 15% saving for each of two states

• Presentation format was manipulated between subjects

• 24 different blocks of experimental materials to which participants were randomly assigned

- The primary manipulation of Study 1 is which reference class (kWh, dollars, or percent) participants were assigned to.

### Other Questions


**General Information**

In this study, electricity use is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh).

A kilowatt hour (symbol kWh) is a unit of energy. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt hours is the power in kilowatts multiplied by the time in hours.

Examples:
- An incandescent lightbulb turned on for 5 hours uses 0.30 kWh.
- A microwave used for a total of 30 minutes uses 0.60 kWh.
- A central air conditioner used for 3 hours uses 10.50 kWh.

**Appliance Energy Question** \

Which of these appliances do you think needs the most energy in average households in Texas over the time period of a year?

- [ ] Cooling (Central A/C)
- [ ] Heating the Home
- [ ] Water Heating
- [ ] Refrigerator
- [ ] Other (Television, Lighting, Electronics, Washer/Dryer, etc.)



**Rank Energy per appliance question** \

How much energy do you think the average household of a family of four in Texas uses for each appliance per year? Please rank each appliance based on how many kWh you believe it uses per year, with 1 being the most kWh used per year and 5 being the least kWh used per year.

*Please rank in order:*

1. [ ] Cooling (Central A/C)
2. [ ] Heating the Home
3. [ ] Water Heating
4. [ ] Refrigerator
5. [ ] Other (Television, Lighting, Electronics, Washer/Dryer, etc.)

## Study 2 specfiics 

The questions in study 2 are quite similar to those in study 1, but we also included a rounding manipulation (rounded vs. not rounded), and a manipulation of the goal (10% reduction vs. 15% rediction)

Note that reference class remains a between-subjects variable, while percent goal, rounding, and state are within-subjects variables. 
 
In study 2, the new design is a 4 state temperature (2 warm vs. 2 cold states) X 2 task goal (10% vs. 15%) X 2 last year’s usage for the family and the state average (exact vs. rounded numbers) within X 3 task reference class (USD vs. Percentage vs. kWh) between. A note on the percentage goals is that they are rounded to the full dollar. For instance, for the Davis family, 10% of their \$6,943.95 cost of residential energy usage is \$694.395; this is rounded to \$694. For the rounded condition, participants are also told that “The numbers for their \[the family’s\] usage have been rounded for convenience.” In terms of randomization, blocks were combined so that there was a block for each condition and order combination. As an example, one block is the smith family with a 10% goal and rounded numbers for the family’s usage first, and the Wells family second, with a 15% goal and exact numbers for the family’s usage. Another block has these but in reverse, where the participant receives the Wells family first and the Smith family second. In total, there are 96 conditions, representing each possible order (2 orders x 4 states x 2 possible significant digit values, and 3 reference classes).
