Departments of Political Science, Communication, and Purdue Polytechnic Institute

Purdue University

 
What is the purpose of this study?

The purpose of this research is to learn about how people perceive and use energy devices and how they make energy-related decisions.

 
What will I do if I choose to be in this study?

Your participation will involve completing an online task and answer questions about energy use. You will be presented with a set of questions and energy data feedback messages. There are no correct or incorrect answers; we are only interested in your opinions.

 

Participation in this research project is voluntary and open to those aged 18 and older. You are free to stop taking the survey at any time.

 
How long will I be in the study?

The study should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

 
What are the possible risks or discomforts?

Breach of confidentiality is a potential risk for all research. The researchers have taken actions to minimize this risk. The safeguards to prevent such a risk can be found in the Confidentiality section of the form. There are no additional risks from the study more serious than those in everyday life.

 
Are there any potential benefits?   

There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study. There may be benefits to general knowledge about how consumers perceive and use energy devices.

 
What alternatives are available?   

You may choose not to participate in this study.

 

Will I receive payment or other incentive?

By taking part in this study you will earn $1.50 applied to Amazon M-Turk account.

 
Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential? 

You will not be asked to provide your name or any other identifying information during the study. After completing the study, we will send you an email and you will receive credit for participating in the study. That email and your email address will not be linked to your responses in the study. Data from this study will be retained electronically on a password protected computer, identified only by the subject ID number, and accessed only by members of the research team. This data will be retained past the end of the project for replicability of any published results and possible future analysis. The project's research records may be reviewed by the National Science Foundation and by departments at Purdue University responsible for regulatory and research oversight.   

What are my rights if I take part in this study?

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate or, if you agree to participate, you can withdraw your participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.     

 

Who can I contact if I have questions about the study?

If you have questions, comments or concerns about this research project, you can talk to one of the researchers. Please contact Panagiota Karava, 765 494-4573, or if she is not available, you may contact one of the other researchers: Torsten Reimer at (765) 496-2765, Sabine Brunswicker at 765 494-2885, or Leigh Raymond at 765 494-4182.

The following is an example of the action plan scenarios you will be asked to consider:   

 

The Roberts family is a family of four from Indiana. The source of their household energy is electricity (not natural gas, propane, solar, etc.). Compared to other, similar families in their state, they used more electricity in their household last year.      

 

The following bill shows the electricity used by each appliance in the Roberts household for the previous year and the total electricity used.
